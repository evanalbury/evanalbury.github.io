      <h3>Bike Gearbox Design - Second Year University</h3>
      <p>Developed a gearbox for an EAPC for transmitting power from an electric motor to the rear wheel.</p>

      <button class="toggle-btn">More Details ▼</button>

      <div class="extra-details">
        <p>
          This project started out with calculating the gear ratio we needed given the power of our motor and to abide by uk law. After that we came up with many methods of achieving this ratio, this included belt drives, 2 step, 3 step and planetary gearboxes. In the end we all agreed that a 2 step gearbox was the best way to go forward
          Once we had our general concept decided on we began to work on the details such as the optimal module and thickness for the gears. We designed multiple CAD models and then ran simulations on these to come up with what we thought was the best solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we had our first design it was time to move onto prototyping. This involved manufacturing our gearbox, mostly through laser cutting and some quick assembly. We ran our prototype 2 weeks before our final test and found that as the motor reached higher speeds the gear connected to the freewheel sheared off the shaft. While we were somewhat dissapointed it helped us greatly in deciding our next steps as in our final design we added bolts to clamp the gears onto the shaft, in addition to just the glue which was originally all we had used. After some other small adjustments we manufactured our final design and were ready to move onto the final test.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final test had mixed results. We were marked in three categories: Material used, Distance travelled and fitting time. Due to our compact 2 step design we scored well on the material used (only using 2 of the 6 available acrylic sheets) and some additional design elements we had incorporated meant we also scored excellently on the fitting time getting within the top 10%. We also scored a top 10% on the distance travelled however due to a small design constraint that we had missed we were capped at 40% marks. The design element was that there were some small external nuts rotating on the gearbox and while we had covered up the motor we had missed these nuts. This was a shame but we all came away with a great overall score and felt very happy with what we had learnt and achieved throughout the project.

      <h3>Water Bottle Rocket Launcher - First Year University</h3>
            <p>Designed and built a launcher for compressed air-powered water bottle rockets. Integrated safety mechanisms, pressure regulation, and conducted launch tests to evaluate trajectory stability and thrust efficiency.</p>

      <button class="toggle-btn">More Details ▼</button>

      <div class="extra-details">
        <p>
          This project began with us manfacturing the mechancial system that would launch our bottle rocket. This was done using many different workshop machines such as a 3D printer, CNC machine, pillar drills and guilloutines. Eventually we had our launcher but it was not stable and would only launch straight up. This is where our designs had to come into place. We designed a stand to hold our launcher as it fired and also some modifications to the bottle rocket itself. After some quick calculations to decide parameters such as the angle of the launcher we set off making concepts. Our final design, pictued below, had rails to keep it at a consistent angle during take off and pegs to keep it in the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once we had decided on our design we manufactured it from plywood and also created a nose cone to reduce drag and fins to move the centre of pressure of the rocket backwards. At this point we had a design that worked and launched a stable rocket so our next task was to test it and work out how to control the distance. We did this through both a MATLAB code and physical tests. By analysing the data from the physical tests we adapted our MATLAB code to simulate our rocket realistically.
        </p>
          Finally, it was our test day. We had gained parameters from our MATLAB code that told us what air pressure and volume of water was needed to fire our rocket the intended 70m. We had 3 launches and all 3 landed within 10m of the intended landing zone scoring us a first class for this part of the project. We all left very happy and I feel like i learnt alot about engineering design as well as skills such as CAD and analysing data.
